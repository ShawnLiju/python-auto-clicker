This is a simple auto-clicker made using python. This program clicks the area 
the cursor is pointed at. For this to work, you will need some things.

By default the code is set to loop for 2 minutes. You can change the 4th line 
which is set to 

```python
t_end = time.time() + 60 * 2

```

to

```python
t_end = time.time() + 60 * "The time you want"
```
